Questions to anwser:
- What factors are most predictive of patient readmissions
-Is there a relationship between length of hospital stay and readmission rates?
-Do certain medical conditions have higher readmission rates?
-Does the number of procedures or medications impact readmission likelihood?
-Are there demographic factors (age, gender) that correlate with higher readmission risk?
-How do different hospitals or insurance providers compare in readmission rates?
-Is there a correlation between billing amount and readmission?
-Do certain medications correlate with lower readmission rates for specific conditions?

Success Metrics:
- Build a model with a 70% accuracy in readmission predicitons
- Identify the top 3 - 5 factors that have a strong association with readmissions
- Creat visuals 
First Dataset (Healthcare General Data):

Contains patient demographics (age, gender)
Has admission and discharge dates (can calculate length of stay)
Includes medical conditions and medications
Contains hospital and insurance information

Second Dataset (Diabetes Readmission Data):

Focused specifically on readmission data
Contains valuable numerical features (procedures, lab tests, medications)
Has prior visit history (outpatient, inpatient, emergency)
Explicitly includes a readmission target variable

Third Dataset (Hospital Readmission Metrics):

Contains facility-level readmission statistics
Has expected vs. actual readmission rates
Allows for hospital performance comparison

Fourth Dataset (Drug Performance Data):

Provides drug effectiveness information
Contains patient satisfaction data
Can link medications to conditions
